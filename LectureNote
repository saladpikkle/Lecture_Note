When it comes to balancing fashion and function within Human Computer Interaction it usually means that unlike architecture or clothing design,  interface design is still evolving.
And HCI designers aim to achieve a harmonious blend of aesthetics and usability in a system which is essential to a designa and its interactibility.

So designers must create interfaces that are both visually appealing and clear while still being highly functional and enhancing user experience while maintaining clarity and transparency.
This can be seen and should be further applied in fields like nonanthropomorphic design where interfaces have humanlike qualities, wearable technology and fashion (like fitness watches, physical performance enhancers like body suits etc.), and human engaged computing where synergized interaction between humans and digvital devices are convenient and efficient while monitoring properties, significance and impact of such products on human stewardship.
